# PixelDrain RateLimit Bypasser - Cloudflare Workers Edition

A complete guide to deploying your own private PixelDrain bypass service using Cloudflare Workers. This setup distributes requests across multiple worker endpoints to help manage rate limits.

![Project Preview](/screenshot.png)

## üöÄ Features

- **Multi-URL Support**: Process multiple PixelDrain URLs at once
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes requests across 10 proxy workers
- **Clean Interface**: Modern UI with individual copy/download buttons
- **No Ads/Tracking**: Completely clean and private
- **100% Free**: Uses Cloudflare's free tier (100k requests/day)

## üìã Prerequisites

- A Cloudflare account (free)
- A domain added to Cloudflare (optional, can use workers.dev subdomain)
- Basic knowledge of copy/paste üòÑ

## üõ†Ô∏è Complete Setup Guide

### Step 1: Create Your Cloudflare Account

1. Go to [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Verify your email

### Step 2: Deploy the Proxy Workers

You'll need to create **10 proxy workers** that handle the actual PixelDrain requests.

For each proxy worker (pd1 through pd10):

1. **Go to Workers Dashboard**
   - Navigate to Workers & Pages ‚Üí Create Application
   - Select "Create Worker"
   - Name it: `pd1`, `pd2`, `pd3`... up to `pd10`

2. **Deploy the Code**
   - Click "Quick Edit"
   - Delete all existing code
   - Copy the entire contents of `proxy-worker.js`
   - Paste it into the editor
   - Click "Save and Deploy"

3. **Note Your Domain**
   - Your worker URL will be: `pd1.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev`
   - Save this subdomain for the next step

Repeat this process 10 times for pd1 through pd10.

### Step 3: Deploy the Main Worker

1. **Create the Main Worker**
   - Go to Workers & Pages ‚Üí Create Application
   - Select "Create Worker"
   - Name it: `pixel` (or any name you prefer)

2. **Configure the Code**
   - Open `worker.js` in a text editor
   - Find these lines at the top:
   ```javascript
   const WORKER_DOMAIN = 'pixel.<cloudflare_domain>.workers.dev';
   
   const PROXY_SERVERS = [
     'pd1.<cloudflare_domain>.workers.dev',
     'pd2.<cloudflare_domain>.workers.dev',
     // ... etc
   ];
   ```
   - Replace `<cloudflare_domain>` with your actual subdomain
   - Example: If your subdomain is `myname`, it becomes:
   ```javascript
   const WORKER_DOMAIN = 'pixel.myname.workers.dev';
   
   const PROXY_SERVERS = [
     'pd1.myname.workers.dev',
     'pd2.myname.workers.dev',
     // ... etc
   ];
   ```

3. **Deploy the Main Worker**
   - Click "Quick Edit" on your main worker
   - Delete all existing code
   - Paste your modified `worker.js` code
   - Click "Save and Deploy"

### Step 4: Test Your Setup

1. **Test a Proxy Worker**
   - Visit: `https://pd1.your-subdomain.workers.dev/api/file/test`
   - You should see an error message (this is expected)

2. **Test the Main Interface**
   - Visit: `https://pixel.your-subdomain.workers.dev`
   - You should see the PixelDrain bypasser interface

3. **Test with a Real URL**
   - Enter a PixelDrain URL like: `https://pixeldrain.com/u/abc123`
   - Click "Convert All URLs"
   - Click "Download" on the generated link

## üåê Optional: Custom Domain Setup

Instead of using `.workers.dev`, you can use your own domain:

1. **Add Custom Domain**
   - Go to your worker settings
   - Click "Triggers" ‚Üí "Add Custom Domain"
   - Enter your domain (e.g., `pixel.yourdomain.com`)

2. **Update Configuration**
   - Update the `WORKER_DOMAIN` and `PROXY_SERVERS` in your code
   - Redeploy the worker

## üîß How It Works

```
User ‚Üí Main Worker (pixel) ‚Üí Random Proxy Worker (pd1-10) ‚Üí PixelDrain API
```

1. **Main Worker**: Serves the UI and generates bypass URLs
2. **Proxy Workers**: Fetch files from PixelDrain with different IPs
3. **Load Balancing**: Randomly distributes requests across workers

## üí° Tips & Tricks

### Scaling Up
- Add more proxy workers (pd11, pd12, etc.)
- Update the `PROXY_SERVERS` array in the main worker
- More workers = better distribution

### Monitoring
- Check Cloudflare Analytics for usage stats
- Workers Dashboard shows request counts
- Free tier: 100,000 requests per day

### Troubleshooting

**"Invalid request" error**
- Make sure you're using a valid PixelDrain URL
- Format: `https://pixeldrain.com/u/FILE_ID`

**Downloads not starting**
- Check if all proxy workers are deployed
- Verify domain names match exactly
- Try a different proxy worker directly

**Rate limits still occurring**
- Deploy more proxy workers
- Wait between large downloads
- Consider upgrading Cloudflare plan

## üîí Security & Privacy

- **No Logging**: Workers don't store any data
- **No Tracking**: No analytics or user tracking
- **Open Source**: Full code transparency
- **Your Control**: Runs on your Cloudflare account

## üìä Cloudflare Free Tier Limits

- 100,000 requests per day
- 10 milliseconds CPU time per request
- Unlimited bandwidth (within reason)
- Perfect for personal use
